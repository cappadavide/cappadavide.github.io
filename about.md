## Why "cappadavide"?

So, the nickname *Cappadavide* doesn't actually come from my first and last name. It all started because my college friends began calling me that. Back in our WhatsApp and Telegram groups, I went by *KDavide* since I'm a huge fan of Kevin Durant (KD), and 'cappa' is how you pronounce 'K' in Italian. The name just stuck, and now I happily go by 'Cappadavide'!
